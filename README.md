# RHAMT Play Area

This project allows me to play with aspects of the RHAMT user interface without actually having to understand the full UI aspects and angular 2

This is a springboot project so use the springboot maven plugin and goal of spring-boot:run 
then goto http://localhost:8080

## Version One
Attempts to demonstrate a possible new menu system with the reports shown in page and not out of page in a new tab.
