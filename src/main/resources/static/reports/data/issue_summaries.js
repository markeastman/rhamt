By offloading the session data off to a remote Data Grid, the application tier itself can be more scalable and elastic.\n* Session Persistence. By offloading session data to a remote data grid, the application itself will be able to survive EAP node failures since the a JVM failure will not cause the session data to be lost.\n* Session Data Sharing. If you have a requirement for multiple applications to be able to share session data, this solution might be able to solve that use case as well.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.
